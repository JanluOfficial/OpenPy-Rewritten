# OpenPy End-User License Agreement (EULA)
##### Listen, I know  reading EULA's is boring but it's not a long EULA, so just read it, okay? It's for good intentions and also so I don't get sued...

This End-User License Agreement is between you (The User) and me (Janlu). 

Subject to terms and conditions of this EULA, I hereby grant you access to redestribute, modify and redestribute modified versions of OpenPy, but only if I (Janlu) am mentioned as the original creator.

However, I (Janlu) prohibit you from redestributing modified versions of OpenPy if you are a Business with 1000+ workers. If this is the case, you will have to contact me at develop.janlu@gmail.com and ask me for permission.

##### This EULA may change in the future

## Modification and Redistrobution
### Modification of OpenPy's Souce Code
You (the End User) are allowed to modify OpenPy's Source Code for your own purposes and even create Pull Requests over at https://github.com/JanluOfficial/OpenPy-Rewritten if you think you made an amazing change. I would love to see your contribution.

### Redestribution
You are allowed to redistribute OpenPy under the condition that I (Janlu) am mentioned as the Creator. You (the End User) are required to mention me by my Internet presence name (Janlu) and the original GitHub repository link (https://github.com/JanluOfficial/OpenPy-Rewritten). If this does not occour, I will take the redistrobution down.

If in the (hopefully very) distant future, the GitHub Page no longer exists, you (the End User) will be allowed to redestribute OpenPy without the GitHub Link.
